It has html/js/css codes for the front end and python codes 
for the back-end. It can communicate to AI LLM models 
such as gemini, gpt, claude, grok.

It must have a feature to upload files to AI LLM models 
as a part of user prompt. 
The files are image, excel, csv, pdf, word, text files. 
Then, the left hand side of the WebUI should display 
the content of a selected file.

Another feature is the content display should be zoomable 
with mouse wheel.
